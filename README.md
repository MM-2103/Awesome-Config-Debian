# Awesome-Config-Debian
My awesome config for Debian based distros

This one is meant for my Debian machine that I use at work, there isn't a lot of differnces between the Arch dotfiles and this one. In fact I try to keep them more or less the exact same so that I would have the same expirence between my Arch and Debian machine.
I noticed that Awesomewm adds some extra stuff for Debian based distros, I am not really sure of what they are supposed to do as I didn't investigate the matter any further.
So because I don't want to have the headache of vetting the dotfiles everytime I make a change, I just decided to make another repo for the Debian one.
